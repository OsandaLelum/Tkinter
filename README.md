### Burgers on Wheels: Mobile Fast Food Truck Report

#### Overview
Burgers on Wheels is a dynamic mobile fast food truck that has been satisfying the appetites of customers since 2022. Specializing in classic British pub and bistro cuisine, the truck offers a variety of well-loved fast food options, including burgers, submarines, salads, and various fish and meat dishes. To complement the food, a selection of locally produced colas and fresh fruit juices are available. The truck operates on a rotational schedule across three approved locations: Diyatha Uyana, Viharamahadevi Park, and Galle Face Grounds. Over the years, it has garnered a loyal customer base, leading to the introduction of a billing system and the requirement for daily sales reports.

#### Payment Processing System
To facilitate efficient and secure transactions, Burgers on Wheels employs a Python-based Point of Sales (POS) system. This system supports multiple payment methods, including cash and credit/debit cards, ensuring a smooth transaction experience for both employees and customers. The POS system features a user-friendly interface developed with the tkinter library, simplifying the payment process. The backend utilizes MySQL for retrieving menu item details, which are crucial for bill calculations, sales report generation, and inventory management.

#### Sales Reporting
The POS system of Burgers on Wheels includes a straightforward yet powerful sales reporting feature. It provides valuable insights into daily operations, such as the total sales value, the number of items sold, and current inventory levels. This functionality aids business managers and owners in making informed decisions by highlighting popular items and trends. Real-time sales data ensures that the management remains informed about the financial health of the business, allowing for timely adjustments to business strategies.

#### Inventory Management
An efficient inventory control system is vital for maintaining optimal stock levels and minimizing waste. The POS system incorporates an inventory management module that enables real-time tracking of stock levels. It automatically updates inventory figures upon sale transactions and alerts for restocking when necessary. This feature not only prevents stockouts but also facilitates ingredient utilization tracking, aiding in cost control and menu optimization.

#### User Interface and Functionality
The POS system's interface is designed for ease of use, catering to different user roles:

- **Customers** can place orders through the system, streamlining the order-taking process.
- **Admins** have access to inventory management features, including the ability to add new items and generate CSV-based inventory reports.
- **Location-specific admins** can manage inventory issuance to the truck, with each item issuance accompanied by a generated PDF for material tracking.

The introduction of a Python-based POS system has significantly enhanced transaction processing, sales reporting, and inventory management, ensuring the business's continued success and growth.
